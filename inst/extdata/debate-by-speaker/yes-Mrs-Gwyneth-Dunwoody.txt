May I ask the hon. Lady if she has ever seen anyone who has been given social support, who has gone the term, carrying a child that she does not desire in circumstances with which she cannot possibly cope, and then, if the good Lord has been more kind to her than man, has perhaps lost the baby at the end? Has the hon. Lady ever known anyone who has suffered that and seen the scar on that woman's personality for life?
