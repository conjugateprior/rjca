I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will reconsider that idea about doctors being considered subsidiary agents. Doctors in this context are just the same as any other social worker who serves the community, and the House is nothing unless it represents the community. Those of us who support the Bill would say that doctors are not subsidiary agents ; they are means to humane ends.

I do not think that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is stating the position fairly. My hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Dr. John Dunwoody) did not want to solve social and economic problems. He wanted to solve, as a doctor, the impact of a social or economic problem upon his patient. The duty is to the patient. He is not asking for for doctors in this respect. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is usually most fair, and I hope that he will acknowledge this.
