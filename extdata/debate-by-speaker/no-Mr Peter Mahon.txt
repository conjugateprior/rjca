Does my hon. Friend, in all seriousness, consider that abortion is the remedy for the social evils which he is outlining?

May I persist in my question?

On a point of order. Before my right hon. Friend gives his own personal views, may I ask whether it is in fact and in truth a real demonstration of neutrality if the Government decide prematurely to give drafting assistance to the Bill?
