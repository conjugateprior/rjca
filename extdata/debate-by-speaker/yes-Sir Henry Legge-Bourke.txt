I thank the lion. Member for giving way, and I assure him before putting my question to him that I have still not made up my mind what to do about this Bill and am most anxious to try to get the right answer. Would he tell us what he really thinks the phrase" capacity as a mother" is intended to mean in Clause 1(1, )? Is it the capacity to bear children, the capacity to bring up a family, or the capacity to wean a child? What is it?
