# rjca

`rjca` is an R package to drive the `jca` java tools for content analysis (bundled with it).  These tools count words, apply content analysis dictionaries to documents, construct concordances, and a few other things.  The little [introductory vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/conjugateprior/rjca/blob/master/vignettes/introduction.html)
has a worked example.

## Installation

The package relies on Java 1.8 or higher.  Installation is described in the  [installation vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/conjugateprior/rjca/blob/master/vignettes/installation.html).  Installation can, it must be admitted, be a bit challenging on a Mac.  See the vignette for details.
